Java (Class &amp; Object) Practice

In this Java project, I am simply practicing my coding skills outside of school to improve my knowledge of coding!
I plan on writing several coding files, such as classes, menu driven programs and much more.
Growing up in Canton, Ohio, of course I am a Browns Fan! So, my love of football will be intertwined in my programs!
